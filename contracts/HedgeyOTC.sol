 * @notice The Seller decides how much tokens to sell and at what price

   * @dev 1) seller: This is the creator and seller of the deal
   * @dev 2) token: This is the token that the seller is selling! Must be a standard ERC20 token, parameter is the contract address of the ERC20
   * @dev ... the ERC20 contract is required to have a public call function decimals() that returns a uint. This is required to price the amount of tokens being purchase
   * @dev ... by the buyer - calculating exactly how much to deliver to the seller.
   * @dev 3) paymentCurrency: This is also an ERC20 which the seller will get paid in during the act of a buyer buying tokens - also the ERC20 contract address
   * @dev 4) remainingAmount: This initially is the entire deposit the seller is selling, but as people purchase chunks of the deal, the remaining amount is decreased to 0
   * @dev 5) minimumPurchase: This is the minimum chunk size that a buyer can purchase, defined by the seller, must be greater than 0.
   * @dev 6) price: The Price is the per token cost which buyers pay to the seller, denominated in the payment currency. This is not the total price of the deal
   * @dev ... the total price is calculated by the remainingAmount * price (then adjusting for the decimals of the payment currency)
   * @dev 7) maturity: this is the unix time defining the period in which the deal is valid. After the maturity no purchases can be made.
   * @dev 8) unlockDate: this is the unix time which may be used to time lock tokens that are sold. If the unlock date is 0 or less than current block time
   * @dev ... at the time of purchase, the tokens are not locked but rather delivered directly to the buyer from the contract
   * @dev 9) buyer: this is a whitelist address for the buyer. It can either be the Zero address - which indicates that Anyone can purchase
   * @dev ... or it is a single address that only that owner of the address can participate in purchasing the tokens
